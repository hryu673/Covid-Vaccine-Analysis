In this paper, we will be analyzing the probability ($\psi$) that BNT162b2 vaccine reduce the risk of getting COVID-19. We use the following two methods: maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian estimation. From calculating our maximum likelihood estimator and Bayesian estimator, we get the results similar to the 95% confidence interval from the paper itself ([0.903, 0.976]). We also calculated the P-Values from both of these estimators and got values of approximately zero, meaning that in the hypothesis test of $H_0$: $\psi_0$ = 0.3 vs. $H_1$: $\psi_0$ > 0.3 (Bayesian) & $H_1$: $\psi_0$ $\neq$ 0.3 (likelihood) to see if the FDA would approve the vaccine. In the end, we rejected the null hypothesis as both P-Values are small enough, meaning that the BNT162b2 vaccine would be approved by the FDA for general use.
