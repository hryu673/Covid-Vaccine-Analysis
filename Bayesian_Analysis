Bayesian Approach: 

The distribution of T is modeled by a Binomial:

$T \sim Binom(n = 170, \pi)$

Beta prior: 

The prior for \pi follows:

$\pi \sim Beta(0.700102, 1)$

Posterior for \pi: 

$\pi \sim Beta(8.700102, 163)$


The Bayesian confidence interval for $\pi$ is given by [2.32%, 8.8%]
The confidence interval for $\psi$ is given by [90.4%, 97.6%]
